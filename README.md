### Arithmetic Calcuator Project

This is a simple arithmetic calculator project built in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It was built as part of [Launch School's](https://launchschool.com) JS230 course. 

The calculator has two inputs for integers, with an arithmetic operator in the middle to select the type of operation to be performed. 

Finally, it has an equal button which can be pressed to perform the calculations. The code contains event listeners so the enter/return key can also be pressed on your keyboard to perform the calculations.
